**Security** — httpOnly `SameSite=Strict` session cookie, CSRF header check, per-IP rate limiting, strict security headers and CSP, Argon2 password hashing, server-side role checks on every operation.

## Quick start

1. **Backend** (see [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md)):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate transdemo-api
   cp .env.example .env          # set DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.
   alembic upgrade head
   python -m seeds.run_seeds --reset
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload # http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```
2. **Frontend** (see [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md)):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev                      # http://localhost:5173
   ```
3. Sign in to the panel at `/admin` with a demo account, e.g. `supervisor@transdemo.com` / `TransDemo2026!`.

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && pytest                    # API: business rules, permissions, security
cd frontend && pnpm test                # unit and component tests
cd frontend && pnpm test:e2e            # end-to-end (needs the API running)
```

## Deployment

A single free Oracle Cloud VM runs the portal, the API and PostgreSQL behind Caddy with automatic HTTPS. See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).
